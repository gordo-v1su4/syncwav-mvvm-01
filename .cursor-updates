## [Current Session] Monorepo Restructure: Following Main Task Checklist

**Major Structural Changes:**

### âœ… Complete Monorepo Setup (Following Checklist Requirements)
- âœ… **Project Structure**: Created proper monorepo with packages/frontend, packages/backend, packages/rust-modules
- âœ… **Workspace Configuration**: Root package.json with pnpm workspaces, parallel dev scripts, recursive build commands
- âœ… **Frontend Package**: Moved all SvelteKit code to packages/frontend with dedicated package.json and configs
- âœ… **Backend Package**: Created Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript, file upload endpoints, CORS configuration
- âœ… **Rust Package**: Set up Rust/WASM module structure with Cargo.toml, placeholder audio analysis functions

### âœ… Backend Service Implementation (Stories 1.2, 1.4 Requirements)
- âœ… **Express Server**: Complete server setup with helmet, cors, multer for file uploads
- âœ… **Upload Endpoints**: /upload/audio and /upload/video with validation and file storage
- âœ… **File Serving**: Static file serving for uploaded media
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling middleware
- âœ… **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript configuration with ESM modules

### âœ… Rust/WASM Foundation (Epic 2 Preparation)
- âœ… **Cargo Configuration**: Proper Cargo.toml with wasm-bindgen, web-sys, audio analysis dependencies
- âœ… **WASM Functions**: Placeholder implementations for detect_beats, detect_transients, separate_stems
- âœ… **Build System**: wasm-pack integration for web target compilation
- âœ… **Console Logging**: Debug infrastructure for WASM development
