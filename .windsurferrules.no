# Windsurfer Rules for Artivus Engine (WaveSurfer Integration Stack)

## General Principles
- Always use WaveSurfer.js for waveform rendering. Do not use custom canvas or WASM waveform code.
- The waveform component (`WaveformDisplay.svelte`) must accept a `url` prop for the audio file location.
- Only initialize WaveSurfer when both the `url` and the container DOM node are available.
- When the `url` changes, destroy the previous WaveSurfer instance and clear the container before creating a new one.
- Never leave multiple `<style>` tags in Svelte components; merge all styles into a single block.

## Audio Upload & Backend
- Audio uploads must go to the backend endpoint `/upload/audio` using the correct backend port (default: 3002).
- The backend must return a valid `fileId` in the upload response.
- The frontend must construct the waveform URL as `http://localhost:3002/files/<fileId>`.
- Always handle upload progress and errors in the UI.

## Waveform Display & Playhead
- The playhead (cursor) must always be visible and styled (e.g., yellow, width 2px).
- Playback controls (play/pause) and current time/duration display must be present below the waveform.
- Playback state and playhead position must be kept in sync with WaveSurfer.js events.
- When a new song is loaded, the old waveform and playhead must be fully cleared.

## SvelteKit & Project Structure
- Use SvelteKit for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend.
- Keep frontend and backend code cleanly separated in the monorepo.
- Document all environment variables and configuration in the README.

## Troubleshooting
- If the waveform does not appear, check the backend upload response for a valid `fileId` and ensure the frontend URL is correct.
- If the playhead or waveform does not update, ensure WaveSurfer is destroyed and recreated on `url` change.
- For port issues, always verify the backend is running on the same port as used in the frontend URLs.

## Linting & Style
- Only a single top-level `<style>` element is allowed per Svelte component.
- Merge all CSS into one block to avoid Svelte lint errors.
