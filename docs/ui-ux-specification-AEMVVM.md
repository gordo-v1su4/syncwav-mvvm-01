# Artivus Engine UI/UX Specification (Version 0.1)

## Introduction
This document defines the user experience (UX) goals, information architecture (IA), primary user flows, conceptual wireframes/mockups, and high-level design guidelines for the "Artivus Engine" project. Its purpose is to serve as a foundational guide for subsequent detailed design, frontend architecture, and development, ensuring a user-centric, intuitive, and powerful audio-visual creation suite.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas
The primary target audience for 'Artivus Engine' consists of music video creators, independent artists, dancers, choreographers, and producers of short-form, musically-driven commercial content. These users seek to produce visually dynamic and musically synchronized video content. They often work with pre-recorded music and aim to align video clips, effects, and transitions precisely with specific musical elements. A key characteristic is their desire for tools that understand musicality and can automate or semi-automate the intricate task of A/V synchronization. (Derived from PRD for Artivus Engine).

### Key Usability Goals
- **Intuitive Synchronization:** Users should quickly understand and apply core A/V synchronization features, making the "first edit" significantly easier.
- **Real-time Responsiveness:** All real-time manipulations and playback must feel instantaneous and fluid.
- **Learnability & Discoverability:** Basic workflow should be easy to learn; advanced capabilities discoverable.
- **Efficiency for Core Tasks:** Target users should complete core tasks faster than with current tools.
- **Error Prevention & Graceful Recovery:** Interface designed to prevent common errors; clear, actionable guidance when errors occur.
- **Creative Empowerment:** The tool should make users feel empowered and creative, encouraging exploration.

### Design Principles
- **Musicality First:** UI and interactions should feel inherently connected to musical concepts and rhythm.
- **Direct Manipulation & Instantaneous Feedback:** Users should experience a direct, tangible connection to media with immediate feedback.
- **Progressive Disclosure of Complexity:** Simple core experience with advanced features easily accessible but not overwhelming.
- **Clarity in a Sea of Data:** Present rich audio analysis data with exceptional clarity.
- **Aesthetic Focus & Flow:** Visually appealing, professional design supporting focused creative work.

## Information Architecture (IA)

### Site Map / Screen Inventory
- **App Entry / Project Hub**
- **Project/Media Management View** ([SETUP] Mode/Tab)
  - Media Upload Area
  - Project Asset Library
- **Main Editing Interface** ([EDIT] Mode/Tab)
- **Export View** ([EXPORT] Mode/Tab)
- **Application Settings** (Minimal MVP)

### Navigation Structure
The application will adopt a single-page application (SPA) feel with a primary "Mode" Tab/View Switcher (e.g., for [SETUP], [EDIT], [EXPORT]) inspired by DAW interfaces like Ableton Live. This promotes a focused, immersive experience.

Global Access Points (e.g., in a persistent header or menu) will provide access to the "App Entry / Project Hub" and "Application Settings."

The navigation will aim for a "fun" and fluid feel through smooth transitions and responsive UI elements.

## User Flows

### Primary Example Flow: A Creator's First Synchronized Video Output
**Goal:** The creator successfully produces a basic, beat-synchronized video preview.

**Steps:**
1. **Initiate Project:** User starts a new project from "App Entry / Project Hub," transitioning to "SETUP" Mode ("Project/Media Management View").
2. **Upload Primary Audio Track:** User uploads master audio; system auto-transitions to "EDIT" Mode ("Main Editing Interface") with audio loaded and waveform displayed.
3. **Upload Video Clips:** User uploads video clips, which appear in a "Project Asset Library" panel.
4. **Initiate Beat Detection:** User triggers beat analysis; markers appear on the timeline in the "Main Editing Interface."
5. **Arrange Video Clips on Timeline:** User drags video clips from Asset Library to a video track area on the main bottom timeline.
6. **Set Basic Synchronization Rule:** User defines a rule (e.g., "switch video every N beats") via controls.
7. **Preview Synchronized Result:** User plays the timeline; video switches in sync with audio in the Video Preview panel.
8. **Navigate to Export:** User clicks "EXPORT" Tab/Mode, switching to the "Export View."
9. **Initiate Preview Export:** User starts export; system processes client-side and provides a watermarked video download.

## Wireframes & Mockups

_Conceptual descriptions for this V0.1 document; detailed wireframes/mockups to be developed in a dedicated design tool and linked here._

### Main Editing Interface (Conceptual Layout)
- **Overall Aesthetic:** All dark mode, avoiding slate blue tones, with a clean, professional feel (possibly "rust-peaks" inspired), and bright accent neon colors for highlights.
- **Top Prominent Waveform Display Row:** For master audio analysis, section definition (AI-assisted with user refinement), and visualization of various marker types (beats, transients, stem-specific markers possibly color-coded).
- **Top-Center Video Preview Area:** For prominent display of the visual output.
- **Left Side Panel (Collapsible):** Project Asset Library.
- **Right Side Panel (Collapsible):** Contextual Controls (tabbed/sectioned for Audio Analysis, Marker Tools, Synchronization Rules including "condition sliders", Effects Parameters, Stem Controls, AI Visual Arrangement toggles).
- **Bottom Main Interactive Timeline:** For arranging video "sequence rows" or clips within sections; performing direct manipulations (cuts, drags, reordering). The currently playing clip on this timeline will be highlighted with a bright accent neon color outline.
- **Master Playback Controls:** Integrated logically (e.g., with bottom timeline).

_Other screens like Project/Media Management View, Export View, Settings, App Entry/Project Hub would be designed with consistent principles, focusing on clarity and task efficiency for the MVP._

## Component Library / Design System Reference
The approach (existing library vs. custom components) is flexible at this stage. The final decision will be guided by the unique aesthetic goals ("rust-peaks" inspiration, "fun" interaction, dark mode) and functional requirements of "Artivus Engine."

If custom, components will be designed following the established UX Goals and Design Principles.

## Branding & Style Guide Reference
- **Theme:** All dark mode, avoiding slate blue tones.
- **Aesthetic Inspiration:** Clean, professional (potentially "rust-peaks" style).
- **Accent Colors:** Bright accent neon colors for highlights (e.g., active elements, important markers).
- _(Specific primary/secondary colors, typography, logo, and icons to be defined in a dedicated branding exercise)._

## Accessibility (AX) Requirements
- **General Commitment:** Strive for a high degree of accessibility.
- **MVP Focus (from PRD):**
  - Keyboard navigability for primary controls.
  - Sufficient color contrast in the UI design.
- **Further Considerations:** Screen reader compatibility for key information and interactive elements will be a focus during detailed design. Adherence to specific WCAG guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA) will be targeted.

## Responsiveness
- **Primary Target:** Desktop browsers for the MVP.
- **Desktop Experience:** The web application will employ standard responsive design principles to ensure a fluid and usable experience across common desktop and laptop screen sizes, adapting gracefully to different browser window dimensions.
- **Tablet Access (MVP):** A message indicating "best viewed on desktop" will be displayed.
