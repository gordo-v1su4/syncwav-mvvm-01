# PM Checklist Validation for Artivus Engine PRD (v0.1)

## SECTION 1: Problem Definition & Context

Let's look at how our PRD addresses the items in this first section of the pm-checklist:

### 1.1 Problem Statement

- [ ] **Clear articulation of the problem being solved**  
  Our PRD (Section 1. Goal, Objective and Context) states: "The core problem it addresses is the difficulty creators (music video artists, dancers, choreographers, producers of short-form musically-driven commercial content) face in achieving a professional, dynamic, and musically-attuned edit without extensive manual effort."
- [ ] **Identification of who experiences the problem**  
  The PRD (Section 3. Target Audience / Users) clearly identifies "music video creators, independent artists, dancers, choreographers, and producers of short-form, musically-driven commercial content."
- [ ] **Explanation of why solving this problem matters**  
  The PRD implies this by stating it "empowers these creators by making the 'first edit' dramatically easier and faster, potentially enabling a 'one-shot' creation experience." It also mentions revolutionizing how they "bring their audio-visual ideas to life."
- [ ] **Quantification of problem impact (if possible)**  
  The PRD doesn't currently quantify the problem impact (e.g., hours wasted, market size of frustrated creators). This is often difficult at the PRD stage without specific market research data, but we could note it as an area for potential future research.
- [ ] **Differentiation from existing solutions**  
  The PRD implies differentiation through its unique combination of "AI-assisted tools that match video movements...with nuanced audio elements," "deep audio intelligence," and "real-time, AI-assisted editing experience." While not a direct comparative analysis, the unique feature set suggests differentiation.

### 1.2 Business Goals & Success Metrics

- [ ] **Specific, measurable business objectives defined**  
  The PRD's "Vision & Goals" section outlines Primary Goals for the MVP. These are product-focused; explicit business objectives (e.g., market share, revenue) are not currently detailed, which is common for an initial product-focused PRD but could be added if available.
- [ ] **Clear success metrics and KPIs established**  
  The PRD lists "Success Metrics (Initial Ideas)" such as Task Completion Time, User Satisfaction Score, Core Feature Adoption, and Performance Benchmarks. These are measurable.
- [ ] **Metrics are tied to user and business value**  
  The listed metrics (e.g., task completion time, user satisfaction) are tied to user value (efficiency, ease of use). Business value linkage would be clearer with explicit business objectives.
- [ ] **Baseline measurements identified (if applicable)**  
  Not explicitly identified, but implied that current "task completion time" with other tools could serve as a baseline.
- [ ] **Timeframe for achieving goals specified**  
  Not specified in the current PRD draft; usually, this comes into play during more detailed project and sprint planning.

### 1.3 User Research & Insights

- [ ] **Target user personas clearly defined**  
  Section 3 ("Target Audience / Users") provides a detailed description of the target users and their needs. While not full "personas" with names and backstories, it's a strong definition.
- [ ] **User needs and pain points documented**  
  The "Problem Statement" and "Target Audience" sections cover user needs (intuitive sync, ease of use, speed) and pain points (intricate/time-consuming sync, manual effort, complex software).
- [ ] **User research findings summarized (if available)**  
  The PRD doesn't explicitly state it's based on formal user research findings but is built from the collaborative discussion. The "Relevant Research (Planned)" section indicates future research.
- [ ] **Competitive analysis included**  
  Not explicitly included in this PRD draft, though the "Relevant Research (Planned)" section does mention "Comparative Analysis of Online DAWs." This is a common area for a separate, more detailed market research document.
- [ ] **Market context provided**  
  The focus on "music video creators," "short-form commercial content," and the issues with existing tools provides some market context.

---

## SECTION 2: MVP Scope Definition

This section of the checklist ensures our MVP is well-defined, focused, and has a clear path for validation.

### 2.1 Core Functionality

- [ ] **Essential features clearly distinguished from nice-to-haves**  
  The PRD (Section 4: "Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)" and Section 8: "Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP") explicitly lists features for the MVP and those deferred, making this distinction.
- [ ] **Features directly address defined problem statement**  
  The MVP features, such as "Advanced Audio Analysis & Interactive Marker System" and "Dynamic Marker-Driven Video Editing," directly address the core problem of "intricate and time-consuming audio-visual synchronization" and making the "first edit dramatically easier and faster."
- [ ] **Each Epic ties back to specific user needs**  
  The drafted Epics in PRD Section 6 (e.g., "Foundational Audio Analysis & Marker System," "Dynamic Marker-Driven Video Editing & Effects") are designed to deliver capabilities that address the needs of music video creators and producers of short-form commercial content, such as achieving precise A/V sync and intuitive editing.
- [ ] **Features and Stories are described from user perspective**  
  The example User Stories in PRD Section 6 (Epic Overview) largely follow the "As a Creator, I want..." format, focusing on the user.
- [ ] **Minimum requirements for success defined**  
  PRD Section 2 ("Vision & Goals," specifically "Success Metrics") outlines metrics like task completion time and user satisfaction, which contribute to defining successful MVP outcomes.

### 2.2 Scope Boundaries

- [ ] **Clear articulation of what is OUT of scope**  
  PRD Section 8 ("Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP") clearly lists features like full song structure analysis, WebGPU transition, and server-side rendering as beyond the MVP.
- [ ] **Future enhancements section included**  
  Yes, PRD Section 8 ("Out of Scope Ideas Post MVP") serves this purpose.
- [ ] **Rationale for scope decisions documented**  
  The PRD implies rationale through its focus on an "MVP" and the nature of the deferred features (often more complex or expansive). However, explicit rationale for each scoping decision isn't detailed. This is often an outcome of prioritization discussions.
- [ ] **MVP minimizes functionality while maximizing learning**  
  The MVP aims to deliver core, high-impact functionality (A/V sync, key audio analysis, real-time manipulation) that should provide significant learning about user needs and technical feasibility. The "Success Metrics" also lean towards learning.
- [ ] **Scope has been reviewed and refined multiple times**  
  This is our first formal review of the PRD (v0.1). The Project Brief phase involved refinement, and this checklist process contributes to further review.

### 2.3 MVP Validation Approach

- [ ] **Method for testing MVP success defined**  
  The "Success Metrics" in PRD Section 2 (e.g., task completion time, user satisfaction scores, feature adoption rates, performance benchmarks) provide the methods for testing MVP success.
- [ ] **Initial user feedback mechanisms planned**  
  This is not explicitly detailed in the current PRD. We should probably add a note or consider how early feedback (e.g., alpha/beta testing with target users) will be gathered.
- [ ] **Criteria for moving beyond MVP specified**  
  Not explicitly defined in the PRD. This would typically involve achieving certain success metrics or validating core hypotheses.
- [ ] **Learning goals for MVP articulated**  
  While implied by the problem statement and success metrics, specific "learning goals" (e.g., "Validate if users can adopt stem-based marker editing workflow," "Determine performance bottlenecks in client-side video rendering") are not explicitly listed.
- [ ] **Timeline expectations set**  
  The PRD (v0.1) does not yet include timeline expectations, which are usually part of more detailed project planning phases.

---

## SECTION 3: USER EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS

This section helps us ensure that the PRD provides adequate guidance for creating a user-centered experience.

### 3.1 User Journeys & Flows

- [ ] **Primary user flows documented**  
  The PRD (Section 4: "User Interaction and Design Goals") identifies "Core Screens/Views (Conceptual for MVP)", and the Epics in Section 6 ("Epic Overview") inherently describe high-level user flows (e.g., uploading media, applying sync, exporting). However, detailed, step-by-step user journey maps are not part of this PRD draft; this level of detail is explicitly tasked to the Design Architect in her prompt (Task #2: "Collaboratively define detailed user flows for the MVP epics/stories").
- [ ] **Entry and exit points for each flow identified**  
  Similar to the above, these specifics are anticipated as outputs from the Design Architect's UI/UX specification phase.
- [ ] **Decision points and branches mapped**  
  Deferred to the detailed user flow design by the Design Architect.
- [ ] **Critical path highlighted**  
  The MVP Epics and their sequence imply the critical path for core functionality. Detailed UX critical paths will emerge with the Design Architect.
- [ ] **Edge cases considered**  
  Specific UX edge cases are not detailed in this PRD; they would typically be explored during detailed design and story refinement.

### 3.2 Usability Requirements

- [ ] **Accessibility considerations documented**  
  The PRD (Section 4: "User Interaction and Design Goals") states "Accessibility Aspirations (MVP): ...keyboard navigability...sufficient color contrast...". The Design Architect prompt also tasks her with specifying accessibility considerations (Task #4).
- [ ] **Platform/device compatibility specified**  
  The PRD (Section 4: "User Interaction and Design Goals") specifies "Target Devices/Platforms: Primarily web desktop for the MVP...". PRD Section 3 (NFRs) also notes "Browser Compatibility."
- [ ] **Performance expectations from user perspective defined**  
  PRD Section 3 (NFRs) includes performance targets like low latency for audio manipulations and smooth frame rates. Section 4 ("User Interaction and Design Goals") emphasizes a "highly responsive editing experience."
- [ ] **Error handling and recovery approaches outlined (from a UX perspective)**  
  This is not explicitly detailed in PRD Section 4 from a user experience perspective (e.g., how errors are communicated to the user, options for recovery). NFRs mention reliability. This often gets detailed during UI/UX design.
- [ ] **User feedback mechanisms identified**  
  As discussed in the previous checklist section, this is not explicitly detailed in the current PRD, with the user opting to continue for now.

### 3.3 UI Requirements

- [ ] **Information architecture outlined**  
  PRD Section 4 ("User Interaction and Design Goals") provides a conceptual outline with "Core Screens/Views (Conceptual for MVP)" like "Project/Media Management View," "Main Editing Interface," and "Export View." More detailed IA is a task for the Design Architect.
- [ ] **Critical UI components identified**  
  PRD Section 4 ("User Interaction and Design Goals") lists key components within the "Main Editing Interface" like "Dominant timeline, waveform display, video preview, stem controls, marker controls, effect controls."
- [ ] **Visual design guidelines referenced (if applicable)**  
  PRD Section 4 ("User Interaction and Design Goals") mentions "Branding Considerations: Clean, professional aesthetic, potentially inspired by 'rust-peaks'." The Design Architect prompt (Task #4) also covers defining the visual style.
- [ ] **Content requirements specified**  
  Specific content requirements (e.g., labels, instructional text) are not detailed in this PRD and typically emerge during detailed UI/UX design.
- [ ] **High-level navigation structure defined**  
  This is implied by the "Core Screens/Views" outlined in PRD Section 4. The Design Architect prompt (Task #5) includes populating the front-end-spec-tmpl which would further detail this.

---

## SECTION 4: FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This section scrutinizes the clarity, completeness, and quality of the functional requirements defined for the MVP in our PRD.

### 4.1 Feature Completeness

- [ ] **All required features for MVP documented**  
  The PRD (Section 2: "Functional Requirements (MVP)" and Section 4: "Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)") outlines the core capabilities for the MVP. Based on our discussions, this appears to cover the essential "wow" elements for the first release.
- [ ] **Features have clear, user-focused descriptions**  
  PRD Section 4 describes the MVP features from a capability perspective (e.g., "Core Media Ingest & Synchronized Playback," "Advanced Audio Analysis & Interactive Marker System"). These seem user-focused in their intent.
- [ ] **Feature priority/criticality indicated**  
  By defining these features within the "MVP" scope, they are all deemed critical for the initial product. Finer-grained prioritization within the MVP typically occurs during backlog grooming and sprint planning.
- [ ] **Requirements are testable and verifiable**  
  The Success Metrics in PRD Section 2 and the illustrative Acceptance Criteria (ACs) for User Stories in Section 6 ("Epic Overview") aim to make requirements testable. For example, "Video switches occur at the correct marker points" is verifiable.
- [ ] **Dependencies between features identified**  
  The Epic structure in PRD Section 6 (e.g., "Project Foundation & Core Media Handling" likely preceding "Advanced Audio Analysis") implies a logical sequence and high-level dependencies. Detailed inter-story or inter-task dependencies will be further fleshed out during architectural design and backlog refinement.

### 4.2 Requirements Quality

- [ ] **Requirements are specific and unambiguous**  
  The PRD's descriptions of functional requirements and features (Sections 2 & 4) aim for specificity (e.g., "isolate at least two key stems (e.g., vocals and drums)"). We've refined these through our discussions.
- [ ] **Requirements focus on WHAT not HOW**  
  Consistent with your choice of an "Outcome Focused" workflow, the User Stories in PRD Section 6 ("Epic Overview") are framed as "As a Creator, I want [to perform an action / achieve a goal] so that [I can realize a benefit / achieve a reason]," focusing on the "what" and "why."
- [ ] **Requirements use consistent terminology**  
  We've aimed for consistent terminology throughout the PRD (e.g., "markers," "stems," "transients," "Artivus Engine").
- [ ] **Complex requirements broken into simpler parts**  
  The PRD breaks down the overall vision into MVP features, which are then further broken down into Epics and illustrative User Stories. This hierarchical breakdown aims to manage complexity.
- [ ] **Technical jargon minimized or explained (in user-facing descriptions)**  
  User-facing descriptions (like story statements) seem to focus on creator actions. More technical terms are generally within sections like "Technical Assumptions" or descriptions of the engine's capabilities.

### 4.3 User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Stories follow consistent format**  
  The illustrative stories in PRD Section 6 consistently use the "As a Creator, I want..." format.
- [ ] **Acceptance criteria are testable**  
  The example ACs in PRD Section 6 (e.g., "Beat detection process can be initiated," "Isolated stems are available for further analysis/soloing") appear to be testable conditions.
- [ ] **Stories are sized appropriately (not too large)**  
  The illustrative stories in PRD Section 6 (e.g., "Story 2.1: ...detect and display beat markers...") seem to represent manageable chunks of functionality for an MVP. Detailed sizing will occur later.
- [ ] **Stories are independent where possible**  
  While there are natural dependencies within epics (e.g., needing an uploaded track before analysis), the stories aim to deliver discrete value.
- [ ] **Stories include necessary context**  
  The illustrative stories are nested within Epics that provide goals, giving them context.
- [ ] **Local testability requirements (e.g., via CLI) defined in ACs for relevant backend/data stories**  
  The Artivus Engine MVP is heavily client-focused. The minimal backend for MVP is mainly for uploads/normalization. As such, specific CLI local testability for backend stories isn't prominent yet. This would be more relevant if the backend scope expands.

---

## SECTION 5: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NFRs)

This section ensures we've adequately considered the crucial quality attributes of "Artivus Engine," such as its performance, security, reliability, and any overriding technical constraints. Our PRD (Section 3: "Non Functional Requirements (MVP)") outlines these.

### 5.1 Performance Requirements

- [ ] **Response time expectations defined**  
  Yes, the PRD specifies: "Real-time audio manipulations...low latency (target <100ms response...)" and "Video playback and real-time effect rendering should maintain a smooth frame rate (target 30fps minimum)..."
- [ ] **Throughput/capacity requirements specified**  
  The PRD mentions: "Audio analysis tasks should complete within a reasonable timeframe..." but doesn't specify user load or concurrent processing capacity for the MVP. This is often an area that evolves with scaling.
- [ ] **Scalability needs documented**  
  The PRD notes: "architectural choices should not inherently prevent future scalability...", and post-MVP features like server-side rendering imply future scalability needs.
- [ ] **Resource utilization constraints identified**  
  Not explicitly stated as constraints (e.g., max CPU/memory for client), but implied by targeting web browsers and the need for "Resource Management" listed as a risk.
- [ ] **Load handling expectations set**  
  Similar to throughput, specific load handling (e.g., X concurrent analysis tasks) is not detailed for the MVP.

### 5.2 Security & Compliance

- [ ] **Data protection requirements specified**  
  Yes, the PRD states: "User-uploaded media should be handled securely, preventing unauthorized access."
- [ ] **Authentication/authorization needs defined**  
  The current PRD (v0.1) does not explicitly detail authentication/authorization mechanisms for user accounts or project access. This is a key area that will need to be defined, likely by the Architect based on implied needs (e.g., saving projects, user-specific settings).
- [ ] **Compliance requirements documented**  
  No specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA beyond general data security) are mentioned in the PRD. This seems appropriate for the current scope unless specific user data storage plans emerge.
- [ ] **Security testing requirements outlined**  
  Not explicitly detailed in the NFR section of the PRD. This would typically be part of the overall testing strategy and architectural design.
- [ ] **Privacy considerations addressed**  
  Covered by the "secure handling of user-uploaded media" point. More detailed privacy policy considerations would come with user account features.

### 5.3 Reliability & Resilience

- [ ] **Availability requirements defined**  
  The PRD doesn't specify quantitative availability (e.g., "99.9% uptime"). The focus is on core features functioning reliably.
- [ ] **Backup and recovery needs documented**  
  Not explicitly covered for the client-heavy MVP. If projects are stored server-side (even for MVP uploads), this would become relevant for the backend component.
- [ ] **Fault tolerance expectations set**  
  The PRD states the "application should handle typical media file sizes...without crashing..." and "Core features...should function reliably."
- [ ] **Error handling requirements specified (system-level)**  
  PRD NFRs mention this broadly. System-level error logging and reporting mechanisms would be part of architectural design.
- [ ] **Maintenance and support considerations included**  
  Not detailed in the current PRD; typically addressed during operational planning.

### 5.4 Technical Constraints (as NFRs impacting design/implementation)

- [ ] **Platform/technology constraints documented**  
  Yes, PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") heavily details preferred technologies (Svelte, Rust/WASM, WebGL2/WebGPU, WebCodecs), which act as guiding constraints. Browser compatibility is also noted in NFRs.
- [ ] **Integration requirements outlined**  
  The MVP, as defined, has minimal external integrations explicitly stated, focusing on core engine development. Future integrations (e.g., stem separation services, AI video gen APIs) are post-MVP.
- [ ] **Third-party service dependencies identified**  
  For MVP, potential dependencies like Essentia.js or specific Rust audio libraries are noted. The choice of specific libraries for the "DAW-level" audio timeline component is also a dependency to be determined.
- [ ] **Infrastructure requirements specified**  
  PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") outlines a minimal backend for MVP uploads, implying simple infrastructure needs.
- [ ] **Development environment needs identified**  
  Not typically part of a PRD's NFRs; this is usually in team setup guides.

---

## SECTION 6: EPIC & STORY STRUCTURE

This part of the checklist examines how well the PRD for "Artivus Engine" (specifically Section 6: "Epic Overview") defines our Epics and the illustrative User Stories within them.

### 6.1 Epic Definition

- [ ] **Epics represent cohesive units of functionality**  
  The PRD outlines Epics such as "Project Foundation & Core Media Handling," "Foundational Audio Analysis & Marker System," and "Dynamic Marker-Driven Video Editing & Effects." These appear to group related functionalities logically.
- [ ] **Epics focus on user/business value delivery**  
  Each Epic in the PRD has a stated "Goal" aimed at delivering value to the creator (e.g., "enable users to upload, manage, and perform basic synchronized playback," "Empower creators with core automated audio analysis...").
- [ ] **Epic goals clearly articulated**  
  Yes, each Epic in PRD Section 6 has a "Goal:" statement. For example, Epic 1's goal is "Establish the initial Svelte application structure...and enable users to upload, manage, and perform basic synchronized playback..."
- [ ] **Epics are sized appropriately for incremental delivery**  
  The 5 Epics defined for the MVP seem to represent significant but digestible chunks of work that build upon each other for incremental delivery of the overall MVP.
- [ ] **Epic sequence and dependencies identified**  
  The numerical order of the Epics in PRD Section 6 implies a logical sequence (e.g., foundational work in Epic 1 before advanced analysis in Epic 2). Explicit dependencies between Epics are not detailed but are intuitively clear.

### 6.2 Story Breakdown

- [ ] **Stories are broken down to appropriate size**  
  The illustrative User Stories within each Epic (e.g., Story 1.2: "As a Creator, I want to upload a primary audio track...") appear to be reasonably sized for initial planning. Further breakdown might occur during sprint planning.
- [ ] **Stories have clear, independent value**  
  Each illustrative story aims to deliver a piece of user-facing value (e.g., being able to upload audio, see beat markers).
- [ ] **Stories include appropriate acceptance criteria**  
  Yes, each illustrative story in PRD Section 6 includes high-level ACs (e.g., "Audio file can be selected and uploaded. Upload progress is shown.").
- [ ] **Story dependencies and sequence documented**  
  The stories are listed in a logical sequence within each Epic in PRD Section 6. Explicit inter-story dependencies are not detailed at this PRD stage.
- [ ] **Stories aligned with epic goals**  
  The illustrative stories seem to directly contribute to achieving their parent Epic's stated goal.

### 6.3 First Epic Completeness ("Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Media Handling")

- [ ] **First epic includes all necessary setup steps**  
  Story 1.1 ("As a Creator, I want to set up a new project in Artivus Engine...") addresses project initiation. The Epic's goal also mentions establishing the "initial Svelte application structure, integrate Vite, set up the main UI layout..."
- [ ] **Project scaffolding and initialization addressed**  
  Covered by Epic 1's goal and Story 1.1.
- [ ] **Core infrastructure setup included**  
  For the client-heavy MVP, Epic 1 focuses on the Svelte application structure. The minimal backend infrastructure is not explicitly detailed within Epic 1 stories but is acknowledged in "Technical Assumptions." This seems reasonable for an outcome-focused PRD.
- [ ] **Development environment setup addressed**  
  This is typically outside the scope of PRD epics/stories and handled in separate team documentation.
- [ ] **Local testability established early**  
  While not an explicit story or AC in Epic 1 of the PRD, the "Testing requirements (Initial Proposal)" under "Technical Assumptions" suggests unit, integration, and E2E tests, implying testability is a consideration from the start. How early local testability for specific components is established would be an implementation detail.

---

## SECTION 7: TECHNICAL GUIDANCE

This section of the checklist helps us evaluate if the PRD provides sufficient initial technical direction and context for the subsequent architectural design phase. Given our "Outcome Focused" approach, much of the deep technical detail is intentionally deferred to the Architect, but the PRD should still set a clear stage.

### 7.1 Architecture Guidance

- [ ] **Initial architecture direction provided**  
  Yes, PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") strongly outlines preferences for Svelte, Rust/WASM, WebGL2/WebGPU, WebCodecs, and openness to robust "DAW-level" audio components. It also proposes a Monorepo structure and a minimal monolithic backend for the MVP. The "Initial Architect Prompt" at the end of the PRD further reinforces this.
- [ ] **Technical constraints clearly communicated**  
  The preferred technologies in PRD Section 5 act as guiding constraints. Browser compatibility (NFRs, Section 3) is also a constraint.
- [ ] **Integration points identified**  
  While detailed integration points are for the Architect to design, the PRD (via its features and "Initial Architect Prompt") implies key integration needs between the Svelte UI, Rust/WASM modules, and the WebGL rendering pipeline.
- [ ] **Performance considerations highlighted**  
  Yes, PRD Section 3 (NFRs) details specific performance targets (low latency, frame rates). PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") also highlights Rust/WASM for performance.
- [ ] **Security requirements articulated**  
  PRD Section 3 (NFRs) includes a requirement for secure handling of user-uploaded media. More detailed security architecture is deferred.
- [ ] **Known areas of high complexity or technical risk flagged for architectural deep-dive**  
  The risks section of the Project Brief (and acknowledged in the PRD's development) flagged performance engineering, synchronization precision, WASM overhead, and browser API maturity. The "Initial Architect Prompt" directs the Architect to consider these.

### 7.2 Technical Decision Framework

- [ ] **Decision criteria for technical choices provided**  
  The PRD doesn't explicitly list "criteria for future technical choices," but the strong preferences in "Technical Assumptions" imply criteria such as performance, leveraging cutting-edge web technologies, and fulfilling the core real-time A/V synchronization vision.
- [ ] **Trade-offs articulated for key decisions**  
  Detailed trade-off analysis for future architectural decisions is deferred to the Architect. The PRD states preferences without deep comparative analysis of alternatives.
- [ ] **Rationale for selecting primary approach over considered alternatives documented (for key design/feature choices)**  
  Similar to the above, the PRD asserts preferences (which came from the Project Brief) rather than detailing a comparative analysis. This is more typical for an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).
- [ ] **Non-negotiable technical requirements highlighted**  
  The tech stack preferences in PRD Section 5 are presented as strong directives. While some openness was expressed for the audio timeline component, the core stack (Svelte, Rust/WASM, specific web APIs) appears fairly firm as guidance.
- [ ] **Areas requiring technical investigation identified**  
  The "Relevant Research (Planned)" section from the Project Brief (which informed this PRD) and the "Initial Architect Prompt" highlight areas like the "DAW-level" audio component, advanced video tech, and A/V feature matching as needing investigation/prototyping.
- [ ] **Guidance on technical debt approach provided**  
  Not explicitly covered in the current PRD. This is typically a broader team or engineering policy.

### 7.3 Implementation Considerations

- [ ] **Development approach guidance provided**  
  The BMAD method itself provides the high-level development approach. Specifics beyond that are usually team operational details.
- [ ] **Testing requirements articulated**  
  PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") includes an "Initial Proposal" for testing levels (Unit, Integration, E2E tests).
- [ ] **Deployment expectations set**  
  Minimally addressed for the MVP (client-heavy focus, simple backend for uploads). Detailed deployment strategy is deferred to the Architect.
- [ ] **Monitoring needs identified**  
  Not explicitly covered in the PRD; this is an operational consideration typically addressed by the Architect and DevOps planning.
- [ ] **Documentation requirements specified**  
  The creation of this PRD, along with the embedded prompts for the Design Architect (to create UI/UX Specs) and Architect (to create the Architecture Document), inherently specifies key documentation requirements.

---

## SECTION 8: CROSS-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This section helps us consider requirements that span across different parts of the system or involve interactions with other systems and operational aspects.

### 8.1 Data Requirements

- [ ] **Data entities and relationships identified**  
  The PRD implies key data entities through its features: audio files, video clips, project settings, beat markers, transient markers, stem data, user-defined sections, and effect parameters. Detailed data models and their relationships are not explicitly defined in this PRD; this is typically an output of the architectural design phase.
- [ ] **Data storage requirements specified**  
  For the MVP, storage is primarily client-side for active project data. The minimal backend is for uploads. Specifics of client-side storage mechanisms (e.g., IndexedDB, file system access) or backend storage details are deferred to the Architect.
- [ ] **Data quality requirements defined**  
  Not explicitly detailed in the PRD (e.g., accuracy of analysis, integrity of saved project state). This is an implicit expectation.
- [ ] **Data retention policies identified**  
  Not explicitly covered. For client-side data, retention is managed by the user/browser. For backend uploads (MVP), retention policies would need to be defined if data isn't purely transient.
- [ ] **Data migration needs addressed (if applicable)**  
  Not applicable for the initial MVP of a new product.
- [ ] **Schema changes planned iteratively, tied to stories requiring them**  
  This is a development best practice rather than a PRD content item. The outcome-focused stories will drive the need for data structures, which the Architect will define.

### 8.2 Integration Requirements

- [ ] **External system integrations identified**  
  The MVP for "Artivus Engine" is largely self-contained. Post-MVP features mention potential integrations with AI video generation APIs or stem separation services like arpeggi.io.
- [ ] **API requirements documented**  
  The PRD doesn't define detailed APIs that Artivus Engine itself might provide or consume for the MVP, beyond the conceptual backend for uploads. The Architect will detail any necessary internal or external API contracts.
- [ ] **Authentication for integrations specified**  
  Not applicable for the MVP given the limited external integrations.
- [ ] **Data exchange formats defined**  
  To be defined by the Architect as APIs and integrations are designed.
- [ ] **Integration testing requirements outlined**  
  This will be part of the overall testing strategy detailed by the Architect. PRD Section 5 ("Technical Assumptions") includes "Integration Tests" at a high level.

### 8.3 Operational Requirements

- [ ] **Deployment frequency expectations set**  
  Not defined in the PRD; this is more of a team/product strategy decision.
- [ ] **Environment requirements defined**  
  The PRD specifies target desktop browsers for the client-side application. The minimal backend for MVP implies simple server environment needs.
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting needs identified**  
  Not detailed in the PRD; these are typically defined during architectural and operational planning.
- [ ] **Support requirements documented**  
  Not detailed in the PRD; an operational consideration for after launch.
- [ ] **Performance monitoring approach specified**  
  While performance targets are set as NFRs (Section 3), the approach to monitoring performance is not specified in the PRD. This is usually an architectural/operational detail.

---

## SECTION 9: CLARITY & COMMUNICATION

This section is a bit meta, as it reflects on the quality and clarity of the PRD document we've been co-creating.

### 9.1 Documentation Quality

- [ ] **Documents use clear, consistent language**  
  We've strived to use clear and consistent language throughout the "Artivus Engine" PRD. Terms like "markers," "stems," "MVP," "Artivus Engine" are used consistently.
- [ ] **Documents are well-structured and organized**  
  The PRD follows the prd-tmpl structure, which provides a logical flow from goals and requirements to epics and prompts for subsequent agent handoffs.
- [ ] **Technical terms are defined where necessary**  
  As an "Outcome Focused" PRD, it avoids deep technical jargon in the main requirements. Where technical terms are used (e.g., Svelte, WASM, WebGL2 in "Technical Assumptions"), they refer to technologies you, the user, specified or are standard terms for the intended technical audience (like the Architect).
- [ ] **Diagrams/visuals included where helpful**  
  This PRD (v0.1) is primarily text-based. Diagrams are typically more prevalent in UI/UX Specifications and Architecture Documents, which will be developed by Jane and Fred respectively. The PRD template itself doesn't call for extensive diagrams at this stage.
- [ ] **Documentation is versioned appropriately**  
  Yes, the PRD includes a "Change Log" section and is currently marked as "Version 0.1".

### 9.2 Stakeholder Alignment

- [ ] **Key stakeholders identified**  
  In our current interactive process, you are the primary stakeholder providing input and direction. In a broader project context, other stakeholders would be involved, but for this PRD's creation, your alignment is key.
- [ ] **Stakeholder input incorporated**  
  Absolutely. This entire PRD for "Artivus Engine" has been built through our direct interaction, with your input and confirmations at each step shaping its content.
- [ ] **Potential areas of disagreement addressed**  
  Our iterative discussion throughout the PRD drafting and this checklist review has aimed to address any ambiguities or differing perspectives as they arose, seeking clarification and agreement.
- [ ] **Communication plan for updates established**  
  This is typically outside the scope of the PRD document itself and relates more to ongoing project management processes.
- [ ] **Approval process defined**  
  Your "next" and "yes" responses at each stage of the PRD review have served as iterative approvals. We will seek a final overall approval for this PRD draft once this checklist review is complete.
